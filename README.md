# Job_Ad_Analysis
A project based on [Venkat Raman](https://towardsdatascience.com/do-the-keywords-in-your-resume-aptly-represent-what-type-of-data-scientist-you-are-59134105ba0d) Raman which looks at job advertisements and tells me if I need to tailor a broader application or a more targeted CV for a given role. 

This work is based on the assumptions in the `skill_set.csv` file.

I will clean up this work once I've actually found a job.
